//Below code will change the format of the number as you require.

//the first argument in the replace method is a regex which matches the pattern and the number required

//the second argument is the separator, you want to add in the digit
//the second param could be ',',' ','.' or anything

//In the regex, we have a number /\B(?=(\d{2})+(?!\d))/g ie 2 here, which takes the number after which separator has to be addded.

//Both first separator and second separator we get it from format as an input ie format:
